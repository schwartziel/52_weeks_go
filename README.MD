# 52 Weeks Go
## Purpose
The purpose of 52 weeks go is to create a repository where I will be commiting 52 weeks of go code in order to learn the language.
It is similar to my other project 52 weeks of bash where I commit for 52 weeks just random small projects that can usually be done in a day or two.
This is done in order to gain familiarity with the language and get used to the syntax as well as build up some skills in the language before diving into a larger project.
It's basically a ramp up project.
## Objectives
The objective of the project is to get familiar with go and to commit to programming in the language once per week
